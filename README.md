### By the end of this project, the student will be able to:
- Work with dates.
- Handle numbers.
- Manage advanced data types such as sequences and their methods.
- Work with functions on a deeper level.

### Requirements:
Build a program that:
1. Accepts an unlimited number of names along with their birthdates.
2. Calculates the age for each person by taking their birthdate as input and returns their current age and the day of the week they were born.
3. Prints the age of the oldest and youngest person and the total number of people passed.
   - If only one person is passed, the program should print: 
     `There is no oldest or youngest person.`
4. Validates the date input:
   - The year, month, and day must be valid (e.g., a month value of 14 is invalid).
   - The input must not contain symbols or negative values.
   - If the date is invalid, the program should return the message: 
     `Invalid date` followed by the name of the person with the invalid date.

### Example:

**Input:**
Khalid, 1-2-1989
Nouf, 2-9-2004
Ali, 9-12-2009

**Expected Output:**
Khalid is 31 years old and she/he was born on Saturday
Nouf is 16 years old and she/he was born on Thursday
Ali is 11 years old and she/he was born on Wednesday
The oldest one is Khalid
The youngest one is Ali
Total People: 3



**Additional Questions:**
1. Sort the people from oldest to youngest and print the result.
2. Print the same input data in reverse order.
3. Print the names of the people who were born on a Sunday.
